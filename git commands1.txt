 	3 Stages in Git:
1. Working copy
2. Staging area
3. Git repository



commiting single file/Commit changes to head (but not yet to the remote repository):
- git commit haha.txt -m "Commiting single file haha.txt"

commiting into repository
- git commit -m "directly commiting into repository"


hard commit/Commit any files you've added with git add, 
and also commit any files skipping the staging(git add) process

- git commit -am "directly commiting into repository"

checking out for repository/ undoing changes made in the working copy
-git checkout -- <filename.txt>

Unstaging/ removing from staging area to working copy area
-git reset HEAD <filename.txt>

	1. first check the git log then notice the which point 
 		of time/commit id you want to return to 
	2. -git checkout <first few character of the commit id> -- <filename.txt>
